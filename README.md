A group project under the course of Advanced Programming Concepts. This project is about Facebook profile analysis

@For retrieving FB data
    - Everything you need is run the Run.py
    - There are some methods there that you can just uncomment and run
    - Please take in mind that you should get your User Token and that's is the only one needed
    - In case of integrating Online token retrieval, we could link it later easily...

@There is a draft of Technical Specification docx file, please just feel free to play with it!
